abstract = {A preponderance of psychological literature indicates gender differences in written and oral communication. This study explores a new channel of communication, that of cybertalk. As this method of discourse is not gender-salient, one might argue that sex differences in communication style would be eliminated or reduced. However, we suggest that gendered power differentials in communication style transcend the medium. Archived electronic discussions (n = 701) on sex-typed topics were selected and analyzed for length, frequency of communication and discourse content (fact vs. opinion). It was hypothesized that male communicators would display power behaviors by writing longer postings, by posting more frequently, and by writing more opinionated discourse as compared to female communicators. Congruent with the first prediction, men's discourse entries consisted of a greater number of words. However, women communicated more frequently than did men, a finding opposite to the hypothesized direction. The third gendered comparison, while not reaching statistical significance, indicated a modest trend with men writing more opinionated communications in two out of the three sex-typed categories (masculine and gender-neutral). Findings suggest that cyberspace, a context where gender of communicators is not salient, remains a male-dominated atmosphere, where gender differentiation and power displays in communication persist, similar to other communication modes.},

The study found significant differences in level of tablet use between sessions, and engagement increased with age. Teachers reported high child interest and drawings as typical to above expectation. Children quickly developed ease with the stylus for drawing. Although technical issues in learning this new technology were encountered, children were interested and persisted without frustration.

The effects of the course on students' knowledge, perceived competence and interest were evaluated through quantitative methods. The sample of the study consisted of 32 primary school students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the Moodle course (Group M, N = 16) and the other one (Group C, N = 16) didn't, and the intervention lasted 6 weeks. The result showed that (1) students made significant learning gains and demonstrated statistically significant higher perceived competence by participating in the Moodle course, (2) there was no statistically significant mean difference in table tennis interest between the two intervention groups. These positive effects on knowledge and perceived competence suggest that Moodle can be used as a tool to supplement traditional motor learning. },

We used discourse analysis techniques to examine the chat transcript of texts for evidence of the relationship among gender, discourse style, and equal participation. We also conducted online observations and surveyed participants' perceptions on their online discussions. Findings from all sources do not reveal any significant gender differences in the online discussions. Respondents unanimously felt comfortable with the manners of discussion that this class demonstrated. However, the overall discourse style showed a difference. The participants used some of the interaction styles more often than others, i.e., exchanging information versus negotiation and argumentation. Instructors should intentionally encourage meaning negotiation in online discussions by engaging students in collaborative problem solving. },

The students in this study used laptops or tablet PCs, and in three of the classes, these were provided by the university as part of a laptop/tablet program. The findings indicated that mobility was the key motivator for the use of laptops, and the learning tasks that students found to be most motivating involved accessing information, authoring (e.g., writing, blogging, note taking) and communication },

The writing of such diaries is ‘tutored’ by a computer program: eHELp supports the writing of sophisticated learning diaries through a modelling and scaffolding of the phases of planning, production and revision. In addition, the learning diaries get published—by uploading them in a cooperation platform—so that the learners can read and discuss their peers’ diaries. The main function of such public learning diaries is to enrich traditional university courses (Blended Learning) with additional elaborative, organisational, critical reasoning, and metacognitive activities in order to foster a deeper processing and better retention of the contents to be learnt. We would like to present the educational rationale of our approach and report the findings of corresponding empirical studies.},

abstract = {Early proponents of computer-mediated communication (CMC) argued that equitable forms of communication could be achieved using online learning environments. However, subsequent feminist research into the use of CMC suggested that the same gender inequities found in face-to-face discussion in classrooms can also be observed in online educational forums. This paper examines the online discussion forum of a postgraduate course in order to investigate whether the interactions occurring there demonstrate the gendered characteristics noted elsewhere in communications research. Analysis of forum data utilised a mixed-method approach and initial findings were used to inform the selection of cases for interview regarding their experience of communicating in the forum. The paper considers possible social and educational reasons why this forum may differ from those previously studied, and suggests possible mitigating methods for achieving gender equity in this and similar contexts.},

Pedagogy has moved from the traditional classroom to technology being integrated into almost every aspect of learning. A way in which this is often done in the college environment is through the professor incorporating a web-based discussion board into their instructional repertoire and creating hybrid courses. The conversion from traditionally taught face-to-face courses to hybrid courses can lead to learning problems, as past research has shown that there are differences in how men and women communicate and interact in online environments. Past studies on gender and interaction in online classrooms have produced conflicting results, mostly due to a reliance on self-reported data and small sample sizes...},

Computers in Human Behavior, 3, 49-59.], and an applied protocol developed for this study. Results show that the less computer anxiety subjects reported, the higher they perceived their CEW fluency to be (p = .001), but there was no significant relationship between computer anxiety and actual fluency (p = .12). There was no gender difference as to actual CEW fluency (p = .11), but women perceived their fluency lower than did men (p = .012). Overall results validate the robustness of the CEW fluency scale, help identify CEW fluency as a digital divide component, and underscore the importance of initiatives to raise women's technological self-confidence. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study does not seek to demonstrate or to discover which mode of delivery is “superior” or “inferior” to the other. Rather, through a quantitative analysis of performance indicators, it seeks to highlight the differences and similarities in student learning outcomes between the two modes of delivery for an undergraduate, social science course, which focuses on public policy and administration. Thus, primarily through the analysis of real-time course data, which covers four academic years from 2005 to 2009, the study aims to provide a better understanding of the differences and similarities between these delivery modes, as far as the issues of concern to administrators, educators, and researchers are},

In mixed groups, females wrote fewer messages than in all-female groups but males wrote more messages than in all-male groups. Students' characteristics and views were described by 19 variables. There were significant gender differences in 11. In multiple regression, the variables most positively related to the number of messages written per student were: a preference for discussions being online; and a high course grade. These partly explained why females wrote more messages. },

This perspective, based on personal teaching experiences, shows that when students are given a framework for thinking that assists in organizing their thinking, they are able to readily adapt to the online teaching format. The presentation of the material in the online classroom gives students a visual and hands-on experience of the organization of information. By weaving this hands-on experience with problem-solving, a framework is presented for developing a new way to think about thinking. This perspective provides college professors a template for encouraging students to use technology to develop the higher order process of critical thinking. },

Students' critical thinking scores were stable across assignments, and evidence suggested that higher performing students may have helped to improve the critical-thinking scores of lower performing students during CSCL. Discourse analysis revealed an emphasis on integrative postings, providing evidence of critical thinking within all CSCL groups. Students reported that communications and team cohesion problems impeded CSCL.

This assumption, however, does not appear to be based on any empirical, experiential, or significant anecdotal evidence. In fact, this view entirely ignores a fundamental aspect of web instruction: Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). In our experience, the effective use of CMC has resulted in an increase, not a decrease, in student-student and instructor-student interactivity.

In this article we explore the different forms and potential applications of CMC for web-based and web-enhanced courses. Further, based on our experiences with three different web courses (Research Methods in Psychology, Statistical Methods in Psychology and Basic Learning Processes) taught repeatedly over the last five years, we address the effectiveness of different CMC forms for attaining specific goals. },

Carr and Kemmis (1986) describe action research as being about the improvement of best practices, of understanding and of knowledge. This brief paper will confirm the importance of identifying the purpose of the technology prior to applying a tool or app for strategic supports. Based on informed best practices, professional reflections will be shared about the apps identified and the strategies applied for using an iPad as an assistive technology.},

abstract = { This study focused on online debates and discussion in a course in which only female students were enrolled to examine whether females would engage in online debate, and if so, would their messages to each other contain traditional elements of debate (i.e., argue, elaborate, critique). The study also investigated whether these elements would be found when students shifted from debates to a discussion-type forum. Content analyses for two debates and one discussion were performed. Results indicate that women argued, provided evidence, elaborated on others' ideas and, surprisingly, critiqued others' comments. They continued to use these elements in their later discussion. The participants also acknowledged and supported others in both the debates and discussion. This may indicate that females use a different style of debate in addition to the traditional one. Only frequencies of overarching and embedded codes are shown in this proposal... },

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A subset of the children (N = 21) from the original study (N = 41) were reintroduced to a Gateway Tablet after a one year lapse. Children recalled how to use it for drawing and writing with minimal reminders. They also immediately transitioned to a Dell Tablet, transferring naturally all the operational knowledge they have gained. They showed ownership and little frustration in using this technology, exhibiting confidence and freedom in experimenting with different options for creating their drawings. As with our observations from the initial phase of the study, even when they encountered computer glitches such as freezing or slow response, they persisted without becoming frustrated or giving up. },

abstract = {Online education is increasing in popularity at the college and high school levels with several studies showing the comparability of e-learning and more traditional methods. Middle school students' ability to function well with this mode of instruction has not been established in the literature, although the circumstances of Generation Z growing up with technology suggest potential success. This counterbalanced, repeated measures study provides empirical evidence of the academic efficacy of online instruction for middle school students learning mathematical concepts. Forty-six Caucasian sixth graders (24m, 22f) in two mixed-ability classes participated in the quasi-experimental study in which they switched between online laptop learning in a supervised classroom with electronic communication only and traditional face-to-face learning for ten different mathematics topics. Academic performance was evaluated by pretests-posttests. All classes were taught by the same instructor with the same/similar practice problems, exercises, assignments, and manipulatives adapted for the environment. Gain scores (except for perimeter) and posttest scores showed no statistically significant differences between the two conditions; TOST (two one-sided t-tests) calculations indicated that gain score and posttest performance was equivalent for the two conditions, showing that middle school students can indeed learn online. Additional studies with more participants or greater diversity are needed. (Contains 3 tables.)},

Many have voiced that the Internet is a more neutral playing field for both men and women to enjoy, and thus, should be taken seriously to create these opportunities for engagement. This paper reports upon a preliminary descriptive study that was conducted during the fall 2003 semester with an online course that involved heavy participation in discussion threads to examine whether gender differences existed in online communication. An overview of the study will be discussed first along with supporting literature. The paper will then report upon the results of the study. Finally, the study will discuss the implications and recommendations for online instructors who are teaching diversified student populations, particularly those courses that have an even distribution of women and men.},

They also indicated that critical thinking skills and goals for course achievement were enhanced in online collaborative discussions. Students did not have a clear preference for group size whether for small groups or the entire class. Technical discussion projects were a preferred component of group discussions. Students were divided on their preferences for group work but overall preferred to work alone on online projects.
